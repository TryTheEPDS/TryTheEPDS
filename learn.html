                                                <p>The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), is an assessment tool commonly used to detect symptoms of depression in mothers after giving birth to a baby. The scale is typically administered during postpartum check-ups. Evidence suggests that the EPDS is also able to detect symptoms of anxiety and suicidality. However, few other screening tools are available to screen mothers, specifically during pregnancy when women may present physicial and emotional symtpoms.</p>

It is estimated that up to 15% of mothers eperience new onset depression, up to 16% experience anxiety, up to 10% experience suicidal ideation, up to 2% experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and up to 50% of women with eating disorders relapse. Despite the prevalence, the bulk of mental health screening occurs in postpartum and focuses on depression, failing to detect other symptoms throughout each stage of pregnancy and birth. <br><br> It is estiamted that pregnant women have significantly lower rates of mental health diagnosis and treatment than the general population. </p>

For example, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, both SMIs, are associated with a higher likelhood of preterm birth, congenital malformations, neonatal morbidity, neonatal hospital readmissions, and having a small or large for gestational age (SGA or LGA) neonate. Pregnant women with schizophrenia are more likely to experience preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterized by persistent high blood pressure which can affect the nutrient and oxygen flow to the baby. Depression during pregnancy has been linked to preterm birth and anorexia nervosa has been associated with low birthweight. <br><br> We also know that postpartum maternal depression and anxiety can lead to impaired mother-child interaction including attachment and breastfeeding rates. Postpartum mental illness may also increase risk for mental illness in the child, including anxiety and impulsivity.  </p>

                                                <p>Dr. Aparna Kumar, CRNP, seeks to improve screening, detection, and treatment of a broader spectrum of symptoms and to ultimately improve outcomes for women with psychiatric symptoms, specifically during the prenatal period. Her research provides that the EPDS can be used during the prenatal period to detect symptoms beyond depression.<br><br> Ultimately, she seeks to provide evidence for a new model for screening in the prenatal period in addition to the postpartum perid. Determining this model has the potential to increase identification of women with prenatal mental health symptoms, provide and accessible resrouce for obstetric care providers, and to improve standard of care for screening and treatment of psychiatric disorders in the prenatal period. It may also help identify additional behavioral trats of women who may be at high risk for mental health conditions in pregnancy. </p>
